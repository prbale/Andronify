There are few AWS services listed below which can be used in mobile applications so that applications are sophisticated cloud-powered.

1. Amazon Cognito ( Identity )
    simplifies the task of authenticating users and storing, managing, and syncing their data across multiple devices, platforms, and applications. It works online or offline, and allows you to securely save user-specific data such as application preferences and game state. Cognito works with multiple existing identity providers and also supports unauthenticated guest users.

2. Lambda
    AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

3. Amazon cognito ( Sync )
    Amazon Cognito helps you identify unique users, retrieve temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials and also offers data synchronization services.

4. Amazon Mobile Analytics
    This will help you to collect, visualize, and understand app usage, engagement, and revenue at scale. Analytics can be collected via the AWS Mobile SDK or a set of REST APIs. Metrics are available through a series of reporting tabs in the AWS Management Console.

5. Amazon S3
    Amazon S3 Transfer Manager makes it easy for you to upload and download files from Amazon S3 while optimizing for performance and reliability.

6. Amazon CloudFront
    Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds.

7. Amazon SNS Mobile Push.
    Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications service for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients. With SNS you can fan-out messages to a large number of subscribers, including distributed systems and services, and mobile devices. It is easy to set up, operate, and reliably send notifications to all your endpoints â€“ at any scale.

8. Amazon DynamoDB
    Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity, makes it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications.

9. Device Farm
    AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time. View video, screenshots, logs, and performance data to pinpoint and fix issues before shipping your app.
