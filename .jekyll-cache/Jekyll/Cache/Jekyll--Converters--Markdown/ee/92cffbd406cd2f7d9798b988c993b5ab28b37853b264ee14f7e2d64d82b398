I"<p>Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption
Authentication</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication is an absolutely essential element of a typical security model. It is the process of confirming the identification of a user (or in some cases, a machine) that is trying to log on or access resources. There are a number of different authentication mechanisms, but all serve this same purpose.</li>
  <li>Authentication is used by a server when the server needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site. Used by a client when the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be.
It is very easy to confuse between Authentication and Authorization.  Authorization is yet another mechanism when security considered. Where Authentication verifies the userâ€™s identity and Authorization verifies whether user has permissions to access resources. We will discuss Authorization in next segment.
Authentication can be verified with the help of few ways which are listed below:
    <ol>
      <li>Password:
a.       Most widely used form of Authentication
b.      Password authentication does not require complicated or robust hardware since authentication of this type is simple and does not require much processing power.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
